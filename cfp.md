Mathematical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition that has been studied by scholars ranging from 
philosophers to cognitive scientists and neuroscientists. Mathematical reasoning involves analyzing complex information, identifying patterns and relationships, and drawing logical conclusions from evidence. It is central to many applications in science, engineering, finance, and everyday contexts. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked new opportunities at the intersection of artificial intelligence and mathematical reasoning, ranging from new methods that solve complex problems or prove theorems, to new forms of human-machine collaboration in mathematics and beyond. 

This workshop is centered on the intersection of deep learning and mathematical reasoning, with an emphasis on, but not limited to, large language models. Our guiding theme is: *To what extent can machine learning models comprehend mathematics, and what applications could arise from this capability?* To address this question, we aim to bring together diverse participants from different backgrounds, institutions, and disciplines into our workshop. Our objective is to foster a lively and constructive dialogue on areas related, but not limited, to the following:

- **Humans vs. machines**: A comparative study of human-level mathematical reasoning and current AI techniques. How do they differ, complement one another, or intersect?
- **Measuring mathematical reasoning**: How do we design benchmarks which accurately evaluate mathematical reasoning abilities, especially in an era of large language models?
- **New capabilities**: How do we move beyond our current techniques?
- **Education**: What role can deep learning models play in mathematics education, especially in contexts with limited educational resources?
- **Applications**: What applications could AI systems enable in the near- and long-term? Example domains include software verification, sciences, engineering, finance, education, and mathematics itself.

**Paper submission deadline**: <b style='color:red;'>August 29, 2025 (AoE)</b><br>
**Author notification:** September 22, 2025 (AoE) <br>
**Camera-ready deadline:** October 30, 2025 <br>
**Workshop:** December 6 or 7 (TBA), 2025


### Submission Requirements

Submissions to MATH-AI 2025 are limited to **4 pages** of content, but may contain an unlimited number of pages for references and appendices. The latter may not necessarily be read by the reviewers. We request and recommend that authors rely on the supplementary material only to include minor details (e.g., hyperparameter settings, reproducibility information, etc.) that do not fit in the 4 pages. The review process is double-blind, so please ensure that all papers are appropriately anonymised.

All submissions must be formatted using [this LaTeX template](https://github.com/mathai2025/mathai2025.github.io/raw/refs/heads/main/_data/mathai_neurips2025_template.zip). Please use <code>\usepackage[dblblindworkshop]{neurips_2025}</code> for submission and <code>\usepackage[dblblindworkshop, final]{neurips_2025}</code> for the camera-ready version.

All accepted papers will be presented in an in-person poster session, and some will be selected for oral presentation. We also permit papers that have been recently published or are under submission to another venue. Please mark such papers accordingly upon submission. The page limit for these submissions is 4 pages. Accepted papers will be displayed on the MATH-AI 2025 homepage, but are to be considered **non-archival**.

Submission site: [MATH-AI 2025 on OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Workshop/MATH-AI). If you haven't already, we recommend creating an OpenReview profile as soon as possible, as new profile creation can take up to two weeks in some cases.


### Reviewing Process

We are committed to a rigorous and fair evaluation of all submissions. Reviewers must declare both domain and individual conflicts before review assignments are made. Final decisions will be made by the organizing team, based on the reviews. Organizers will recuse themselves from any submission with which they have a conflict, as identified by OpenReview. Each submission will receive at least three reviews, and there will be no rebuttal phase. Final decisions will rely heavily on reviewer feedback; exceptions will be made only in rare cases and must be approved by at least two non-conflicted organizers.

### Camera-ready Requirements

The final version of all accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages) so that reviewersâ€™ comments can be taken into account.

Please email any inquiries to [mathai.neurips2025@gmail.com](mailto:mathai.neurips2025@gmail.com).
